/**
 * @deprecated Use the `useRevalidator` hook from `@remix-run/react`.
 *
 * Trigger a refresh of the current routes loaders.
 *
 * This work by sending a `POST` request with a fetcher.submit to /dev/null in
 * order to force loaders to run again.
 *
 * You need to create `app/routes/dev/null.ts` and define an action that
 * returns null.
 *
 * It returns also a type and state strings with the process of the refresh.
 *
 * @example
 * let { refresh } = useDataRefresh();
 * return <button type="button" onClick={() => refresh}>Reload</button>;
